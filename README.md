Yet Another Availabilty Planner

TODOS:
- Plan board: date in table header
- Datepicker
- add end date automatically (always 2 weeks)

Features under consideration:
- Filter Sprint list by Team (or quick search)
- Filter user list by Team (or quick-search)
- Statistics: Charts for Availability vs Story points
- delete Sprint and usersBySprint
- delete user (what about their previous works? either mess up statistics or try to add "empty user" instead

Gold Plating:
- Consolidate availability of non-developers (Phil, Tom, ...) across teams (feasible? what about Sprint start differences?)
