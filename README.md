Yet Another Availabilty Planner

TODOS:
- show a spinner while saving sprint data
- delete Sprint and usersBySprint
- inline-change for existing users: Team and isDeveloper
- change user data (team, isDev, name)
- non-developers: enable de-select on Sprint creation

Features under consideration:
- Filter Sprint list by Team (or quick search)
- Filter user list by Team (or quick-search)
- Statistics: Charts for Availability vs Story points
- delete user (what about their previous works? either mess up statistics or try to add "empty user" instead

Gold Plating:
- Consolidate availability of non-developers (Phil, Tom, ...) across teams (feasible? what about Sprint start differences?)
