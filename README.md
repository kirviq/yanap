Yet Another Availabilty Planner

TODOS:
- create new Sprint / usersBySprint
- enable change of sprint name (board.html)
- enable entry of story points (board.html)
- add users
- delete Sprint and usersBySprint

Features under consideration:
- Statistics: Charts for Availability vs Story points
- Filter Sprint list by Team
- delete user (what about their previous works? either mess up statistics or try to add "empty user" instead

Gold Plating:
- Consolidate availability of non-developers (Phil, Tom, ...) across teams (feasible? what about Sprint start differences?)
